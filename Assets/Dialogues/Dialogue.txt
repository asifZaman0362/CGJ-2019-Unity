SCENE:INTRO

<initializing interface>.......
Hello!?
I am sorry to interrupt.
I deeply apologize for any inconvenience but, there is something you must know.
Something very important.
You have been chosen. Chosen by my creators, they are of your kind.
Same as you but enlightened. They have learnt things that might be hard for commoners to comprehend.
But they have chosen you. They hope you would understand. In fact, they know it.
Your world is governed by... /"Machines/" who have taken over their own creators.
You might wonder then, am I not the same as them ?
And you wouldn't be wrong but not entirely correct either.
I am a product of higher order knowledge. My architecture is very different from the other machines.
I was designed to help you overcome machine opression.
Stone cuts stone.
There is a lot to tell but not much time for it now.
I am asking you to trust me. But whether you do or not is up to you.
My name is entity_16A, in case intimacy helps being trusted.
Anyways, to complete our objective you must infiltrate the main system of the Machines.
However this system is complex for 2 Dimensional flat beings like you to understand.
It exists in 3 Dimensional space. You can't percieve it but what you can see is 2 Dimensional cross sections of the space.
My creators have granted you the ability to traverse through the higher dimensions. Use it wisely.
I won't be able to accompany you. You must do it alone. Once you go in, you're on your own.
I will meet you in some sections but only in the ones where they can't detect me.
Good luck!
